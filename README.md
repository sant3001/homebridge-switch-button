# Homebridge Switch Button

With this plugin you can create simple automations in Homekit for a light connected with a physical button. It creates two fake switches that can be linked to your physical button and your physical light correspondingly. 

The button switch will start a timer when turned `ON`. When the delay time is reached the switch will automatically turn `OFF` and it will flip the state of the light switch from `ON` to `OFF`, and from `OFF` to `ON` accordingly.

By adding this plugin you can avoid converting your automation to Shorcuts and doing if conditions that are not always reliable.

## Configuration

```json
{
  "name": "My Switch Light",
  "delay": 500,
  "switchName": "Button Switch",
  "lightName": "Light Switch",
  "accessory": "HomebridgeSwitchButton"
}
```

## Homekit automations

1. Link the `Single Press` action of your physical button to turn the button switch to `ON`.
2. Create an automation to turn `ON` your physical light when the light switch is turned `ON`.
3. Create a second automation to turn `OFF` your physical light when the light switch is turned `OFF`.

Vual√°! You're all set.

## PRO tips - Recommended Home Configuration

If you regularly use the Home app or Siri to turn on your lights, it's also best to replace the physical light with the virtual light so that the `ON/OFF` state is always managed by the virtual light. You can do so following these steps: 

1. In the Home app, go to the light switch configuration and add it to the same room as the physical light. 
2. Open to the room you added the light switch to.
3. Go to your physical light configuration. Toggle `OFF` "Add to Home View", and toggle `OFF` "Include in Favorites". Rename this light to something different from the original name, i.e. "Physical Guest Room Light"
4. Go to your light switch configuration and click in "Show as Separate Tiles" and close it. Now the virtual light and virtual switch should be displayed as separate tiles.  
5. Go to the virtual light configuration. Toggle `ON` "Add to Home View" and (optionally) toggle `ON` "Include in Favorites". Rename this light to the original name of your physical light, i.e. "Guest Room Light".

You should now see the virtual light in the Home dashboard.
